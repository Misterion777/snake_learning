# Snake Learning
Small project to beat the snake game with use of deep reinforcement learning and computer vision.
Used techs and libraries:
* [OpenCV](https://github.com/skvark/opencv-python) for object recognition
* [Tensorforce](https://github.com/tensorforce/tensorforce) for Deep RL (DQN in particular)

Right now all CV is made based on playsnake.org, but there are more online snake games to support in future.
